# DOM Testing Demo

This is an experimental project for testing HTML and vanilla JS with Jest and `@testing-library/dom`. You can [read my article on Medium](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-unit-test-html-and-vanilla-javascript-without-a-ui-framework-c4c89c9f5e56?source=friends_link&sk=15836e19406fd422a13411e3ef497c0d) about this project as well.

## Motivation

I've used Jest and `@testing-library/react` alongside React extensively in professional and personal projects, but I've never tried writing unit tests to test a UI that was created _without_ any UI frameworks or libraries.

## Development

If you'd like to run this project locally, clone the repo and then:

1. `yarn install` (or `npm install`) to install dependencies
2. `yarn start` (or `npm start`) to preview the app locally
3. `yarn test` (or `npm test`) to run the tests
